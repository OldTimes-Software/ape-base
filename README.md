# ape-base

This repository provides content used as a foundation for Ape Tech derived games. Ideally, you would check this out into Ape's "projects" directory and then set it as a dependecy per your own project file.

It should also serve as an example of how you can structure a project for use with Ape.

As an example, to use this content as part of your own project, set the following in your project file.

```
node.utf8
object project
{
    ...

    ; Keep in mind the order here; your own project will come first, 
    ; then followed by the first item on this list, 
    ; and then followed by the rest
    array string dependencies
    {
        "base" ; or 'ape-base' depending on how you checked this out
    }

    ...
}
```
